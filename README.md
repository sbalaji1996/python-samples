# python-samples
A quick sample of the types of python code I've written in the last year.

california-water-usage: a folder containing ipynb, csv, and geojson files that allowed me to explore trends in income and water usage in calfornia.

optimization-regression-multiplelinearregression: a folder containing ipynb, cvs, and py files that allowed me to use the topics of optimization, regression, and multiple linear regression in my analysis of data.
