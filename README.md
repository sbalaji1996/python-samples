# python-samples
A quick sample of the types of python code I've written in the last year.

california-water-usage: a folder containing ipynb, csv, and geojson files that allowed me to explore trends in income and water usage in calfornia.

ants: a folder containing files that pertain to a mock-up of the game “Plants vs Zombies”, written in python; code was mainly written in ants.py.

maps: a folder containing files that pertain to a restaurant recommendation application, written in python; code was mainly written in recommend.py.

scheme 3: a folder containing files that pertain to a compiler for a subset of the Scheme 3 language, written in python; code was mainly written in scheme.py.
